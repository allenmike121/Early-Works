Early-Works Repository
         Is where i store or compile the little web projects i've created using html and css..

What i learned?
*Basic HTML
*Basic CSS

My thoughts?
            Little by little i learned that coding can be fun and immersive when you soak yourself into studying and
immediately applying what you've learned on the internet web dev tutorials..
